- Relevance of the Problem: The challenge of defining a robust LLM evaluator for request → LLM → response workflows is pertinent for several reasons:
	1.	Human Evaluation Limitations: Manual assessment of LLM outputs is resource-intensive and may lack scalability. LLMs-as-Judges offer a cost-effective alternative by automating this evaluation process (https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	2.	Alignment with Human Judgment: Studies have demonstrated that LLMs can align closely with human evaluators in assessing the quality of LLM-generated responses, making them suitable for tasks like instruction-following and code generation (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12319771/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
	3.	Advancements in Evaluation Methodologies: The field has seen the development of various evaluation strategies, including pointwise, pairwise, and pass/fail evaluations, which enhance the effectiveness of LLMs as evaluators (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12319771/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- Assessment of the Approach
	1.	Dataset Acquisition: Identifying a dataset with coding instructions, LLM-generated solutions, and human annotations is foundational. HumanEval dataset offers this (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374, https://github.com/openai/human-eval/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)
	2.	Problem Definition: Formally defining the request → LLM → response problem is crucial for establishing clear evaluation criteria. The LLMs-as-Judges paradigm has been systematically defined in literature, providing a framework for such formalizations  (https://arxiv.org/html/2412.05579v2?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
	3.	Evaluator Definition: Defining the components of an evaluator, such as scoring mechanisms and alignment metrics, is essential. Various evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and G-Eval, have been proposed to assess LLM outputs (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/working-with-llms/evaluation/list-of-eval-metrics?utm_source=chatgpt.com) & (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/llm-evaluation-metrics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
	4.	Evaluator Construction: Building evaluators using different methods, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, is a practical approach. Tools like AlpacaEval facilitate the creation and testing of custom evaluators (https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
	5.	Evaluator Evaluation Metrics: Defining metrics to compare evaluators is vital. Metrics like accuracy, relevance, and coherence are commonly used to assess the performance of LLM evaluators (https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
	6.	Evaluation and Comparison: Applying evaluators to the dataset and comparing their performance against human evaluations ensures the reliability of the evaluators. Studies have shown that LLMs can achieve high alignment with human judgments in various evaluation tasks (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12319771/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
