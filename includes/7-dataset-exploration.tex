\section{Dataset Exploration}
Datasets play a critical role in advancing this line of research. While reviewing the literature we could find that several of these benchmark datasets are prominent and widely used. For code generation tasks, the following is particularly relevant:~\cite{chen2021evaluating} introduce \emph{HumanEval}. This dataset is structured to include a diverse set of programming tasks, each with a clear specification and a set of unit tests to validate the generated code. Here correctness is not measured by human input, but is tested via unit tests. However, \citet{fu2023gptscore} stress that correctness is only part of the picture: requirement satisfaction and style adherence are equally important.
