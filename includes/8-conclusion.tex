\section{Conclusion}
The literature on LLMs as judges highlights a rapidly evolving research area with deep implications for automated evaluation. From JudgeLM to GPTScore, scholars have begun to systematize evaluation frameworks that balance correctness, alignment with human preferences, and robustness. While progress is evident, meta-evaluation—the evaluation of evaluators—remains both a conceptual and technical challenge. Advancing this area will require larger multi-domain datasets, robust bias analysis, and frameworks that integrate human and automated evaluation seamlessly. \cite{dummy}
